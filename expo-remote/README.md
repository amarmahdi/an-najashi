```sh
cd /path/to/AnNajashi/expo-remote
```

2. Install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

3. Start the Expo development server:

```

4. Use Expo Go app on your mobile device to scan the QR code or run on an emulator.

## Usage

1. Launch the app on your mobile device
2. Authenticate using biometrics (if enabled)
3. Use the "Network Discovery" feature to automatically find prayer displays on your network
4. Or manually enter the IP address and port of your prayer display (e.g., 192.168.1.100:3000)

## Security

The remote app uses local biometric authentication when available to prevent unauthorized access to your prayer display settings. All communication happens over your local network.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your mobile device is on the same network as your prayer display
- Check that the prayer display app is running and has WebSocket server enabled
- If you can't connect manually, check the IP address and port are correct
- Restart the prayer display app if persistent connection issues occur
